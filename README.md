## About

**INFO: The DB is no longer available in Supabase.**

This is just a side project and one of my college assignments.

## Testing

What do you mean by testing? **I test with my brain**.
I have tested all of these, using my brain, using my exceptional thinking skill.

LMAO, NO. I just didn't have the time to write some unit test.

## How-to-run

In the mean time, this cannot be run outside the creator's machine because he (me, an exceptional thinker) haven't created the database migration and the .env.example file.

Please, be patient. I will do that, maybe...
